No compiler, linker or IDE required! Now you can code directly on the device itself. CircuitPython makes it easier than ever to get prototyping by requiring <em>no upfront desktop software downloads</em> - open up <b>main.py</b> in any text editor and type away.\n</br>\n\n<br/>\n<b>It is great for beginners:</b> With CircuitPython you can write clean and simple Python code to control hardware instead of having to use complex low-level languages like Arduino, C or C++. The simplicity of the Python programming language makes CircuitPython an excellent choice for beginners who are new to programming and hardware. \n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Experts love it too:</b> skip the annoyances of long-compile cycles, pointers and memory management - get right to the programming you want to do. CircuitPython is also quite full-featured and supports all of Python's syntax (Python version 3.4) and implements some useful parts of the Python standard library so even seasoned Python veterans will find CircuitPython familiar and fun to use.\n</br>\n\n\n<br/>\nPick up a Circuit Playground Express if you want everything-and-the-kitchen-sink-too, Gemma M0 for small wearables, Trinket M0 for compact breadboard-friendly designs, Metro M0 Express for shield-compatibility or Feather M0 Express to take advantage of the Feather system\n</br>\n\n\n<br/>Visit the <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython\">CircuitPython section of our Learn Guide to learn more about using this awesome coding language</a> and <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/channels/327254708534116352/327298996332658690\">visit our #circuitpython channel on Discord to start chatting with the CircuitPython community</a>, today!\n</br>\n<hr>",
